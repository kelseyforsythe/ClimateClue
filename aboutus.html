                <h2>A Cleaner, Greener Future is within Reach.</h2>
                <p>We are a group of people dedicated to action against climate change. We, alongside over 140 organisations (including the National Trust, Women's Institute, Oxfam, and RSPB) are reaching across the UK to show our love for all the things we want to protect from climate change, and to ask politicians to put aside their differences and commit to doing whatever is necessary to protect them.</p>
                <p>Together we can achieve so much and reach millions with campaigns and with you, our advocates. Already, so much progress has been made such as the UK becoming the first major economy to set a legally binding net zero target. </p>

                <h2>Our Goals</h2>  
                <p>An incredible 85% of people in the UK support renewable energy â€” and yet people think it has only 9% of public support. We address this gap by reaching and inspiring new public audiences to engage with the issue of climate change.</p>  
                <p>More and more of us are feeling the effects of climate change on what we love in our everyday lives and in our communities. We can turn that into a strong and unified voice politicians cannot avoid listening to.</p>
				<p>We can make sure that public voice is heard by those who can make a difference in creating a cleaner, more secure future.</p>
