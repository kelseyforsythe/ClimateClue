                            <p>The Earth's average temperature has increased about 2 degrees Fahrenheit during the 20th century.</p>
                            <p>Two degrees may sound like a small amount, but it's an unusual event in our planet's recent history. Earth's climate record, preserved in tree rings, ice cores, and coral reefs, shows that the global average temperature is stable over long periods of time. Furthermore, small changes in temperature correspond to enormous changes in the environment.</p>

							<h2>A Degree of Difference</h2>
                            <p>Global climate change has already had observable effects on the environment. Glaciers have shrunk, ice on rivers and lakes is breaking up earlier, plant and animal ranges have shifted and trees are flowering sooner.</p>
                            <p>Effects that scientists had predicted in the past would result from global climate change are now occurring: loss of sea ice, accelerated sea level rise and longer, more intense heat waves.</p>

                               <p>"Taken as a whole," the IPCC states, "the range of published evidence indicates that the net damage costs of climate change are likely to be significant and to increase over time."</p>
                               <p>There are a number of factors which will be impacted by the changing climate, such as:</p>
